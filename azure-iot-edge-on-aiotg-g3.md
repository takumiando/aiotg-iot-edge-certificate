# Step 1: Perequisites

You should have the following items eady before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/doc/devbox_setup.md)
-   [Setup your IoT hub](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p)
-   [Add the Edge Device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux)
-   [Add the Edge Modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux#deploy-a-module)

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

Armadillo-IoT Gateway G3 M1 model supports Azure IoT Edge with Linux kernel version x1-v4.9-at3 or later.

You can check Linux kernel version running on your device with following command:

```
$ uname -a
```

If your device uses older kernel, you must upgrade it.
See the following document to upgrade the kernel on your device:

- [Armadillo-IoT Gateway G3 Product Manual](https://manual.atmark-techno.com/armadillo-iot-g3/armadillo-iotg-g3_product_manual_ja-2.0.2/ch11.html#sct.update_image_simply.linux)
  - Currently, this document is only japanese version yet.

And, see the following document to install Azure IoT Edge runtime on your device:

- [Install Azure IoT Edge runtime on Linux (ARM32v7/armhf)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux-arm)

**Details of the equirement:**

The following components come pe-installed or at the point of distribution on the device to customer(s):

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuation file
-   Moby containe management system
-   A vesion of `hsmlib`
